# Svelte for Meteor

Use [the magical disappearing UI framework](https://svelte.technology) with Meteor.

## Installation

To use `meteor-svelte`, run `meteor add svelte:compiler` or add `svelte:compiler` manually to `.meteor/packages`.

## Options

Compiler options can be specified with a `"svelte:compiler"` property in `package.json`. For example:

```
{
  ...
  "svelte:compiler": {
    "extensions": ["svelte"],
    "hydratable": true,
    "css": false
  }
}
```

**`extensions` (default: `["html", "svelte"]`)**

An array of file extensions to be recognized by the compiler.
This option is useful if you want to process HTML files with a different package, e.g., `blaze-html-templates` or `static-html`.
Note that HTML files with top level `<head>` or `<body>` tags are never processed by the Svelte compiler.
Instead, the contents of the tags are added to the respective sections in the HTML output generated by Meteor.

**`hydratable` (default: `false`)**

By default, Svelte removes server-rendered static HTML when the application is loaded on the client and replaces it with a client-rendered version.
If you want to reuse (hydrate) server-rendered HTML, set the `hydratable` option to `true` (which generates additional code for client components) and [use the `hydrate` option when instantiating your root component](https://svelte.technology/guide#hydration).

**`css` (default: `true`)**

Svelte can [extract styles for server-side rendering](https://svelte.technology/guide#server-side-api).
If you want to render CSS on the server, you might want to set the `css` option to `false` so that client-rendered components don't insert CSS into the DOM.

## Server-Side Rendering

`meteor-svelte` supports server-side rendering with minimal configuration.
If you import Svelte components on the server, they are automatically built for server-side rendering.
See the [Svelte guide](https://svelte.technology/guide#server-side-rendering), the [example app](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/ssr-example), and the `hydratable` and `css` options above for more details.

## Examples

* ["Hello world" example from the Svelte guide](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/hello-world-example)
* [Tracker integration](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/tracker-example)
* [Server-side rendering](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/ssr-example)

## Update Notes

* 2018-01-31: Version 1.46.1_1 of `svelte:compiler` is the last version that works with Meteor 1.5 and older. Later versions require at least Meteor 1.6.

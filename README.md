# Svelte for Meteor

Use [the magical disappearing UI framework](https://svelte.technology) in Meteor

## About

This repository contains two Meteor build plugins, `svelte:compiler` and `svelte:compiler-no-html`.
`svelte:compiler` compile files with both `.svelte` and `.html` extensions, `.html` is the official file extension for
Svelte components. `svelte:compiler-no-html` only compile files with the `.svelte` extension. Usually, `svelte:compiler`
is the plugin you should install. However, if you want to use Svelte in a project that contains HTML files of a
different format, e.g., Blaze templates, you can install `svelte:compiler-no-html` instead.

## Installation

Run `meteor add svelte:compiler[-no-html]` or add `svelte:compiler[-no-html]` manually to `.meteor/packages`.
For `svelte:compiler`, other plugins that process HTML files, e.g., `blaze-html-templates`
(the default for new Meteor projects) or `static-html`, have to be removed.

## Additional features

* ES2015+ in Svelte components
* Source maps

## Top level head and body tags

You can use head and body tags as usual with `svelte:compiler`.
HTML files with top level head or body tags are not processed by the Svelte compiler.
Instead, the contents of the tags are added to the respective section in the HTML output generated by Meteor.
